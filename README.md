# Mara

Mara is a MIT licensed, pick-n-mix style library for web sites, built around
polyfilling future web standards such as [DOM4](http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-dom-20150428/)
and [Custom Elements](http://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/) and enhancing them
with a few extra utilities.

## Usage

Mara is written in ES6 and should be used with a package loader such as
[JSPM](http://jspm.io).
